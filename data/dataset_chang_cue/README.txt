Onset times are same for all subjects (ectp_onsets.txt)
In ectp_onsets.txt, these times are in seconds with respect to the very beginning of the fMRI scan.
In the preprocessed fMRI data (*dr_), the first 7 volumes are dropped, so these onsets need to be adjusted accordingly if using that data (subtract 2.1 * 7 = 14.7 seconds)
