ADB: auditory stimulus-cued deep breaths
Onset times are same for all subjects (adb_onsets.txt)
In adb_onsets.txt, these times are in seconds with respect to the very beginning of the fMRI scan.
In the preprocessed fMRI data (*dr_), the first 7 volumes are dropped, so these onsets need to be adjusted accordingly if using that data (subtract 2.1 * 7 = 14.7 seconds)

sub_0015-mr_0009: nframes=400 (forgot to instruct subject to keep eyes closed. Looks like they didn't take the last 2 breaths?)
